# Application of LDA topic model to song lyrics

This repository contains the files for the project "Application of LDA topic model to song lyrics" for the seminar Advanced Statistical Modelling at the Free University Berlin in the Summer Term 2019.

## Description

The data for the project was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics and https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics).
The dataset contains song lyrics from different artists and genres.

The project applies the topic modelling algorithm "Latent Dirichlet Allocation" on a set of song lyrics to discover the number of topics and what the found topics are about.

## Content

The project is divided into the following parts:
1. Creation of corpus:
   - Tokenization
   - Pre-processing (lowercasing, stemming, removal of stopwords)
   - Transformation into the Document-Term-Matrix representation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - General analysis by genre (e.g. total and distinct words per song, most common words)
   - Sentiment analysis using the _afinn_ lexicon from the `sentiments` dataset from the `R` package `tidytext`
4. Estimation of number of topics:
   - Optimization of following metrics: Perplexity ([[2]](#2)), CaoJuan2009 ([[3]](#3)), Arun2010 ([[1]](#1)), Deveaud2014 ([[4]](#4))
5. LDA results' analysis:
   - Per-topic-per-word probability
   - Per-document-per-topic probability
